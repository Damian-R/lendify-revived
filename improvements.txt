1. Move all model modification to methods on the model rather than in express routes

ie. make Offer.completeOffer() which does everything in the /offers/:id/start route (would make it easier to test and clean up the code)

2. Add expired [Boolean] field to Transactions instead of doing the check on the front-end

3. Add many more validations to avoid unwanted scenarios

For example, right now some issues are "protected" only via the front-end.
ie. when a transaction is expired, the button to return the item is replaced,
but the POST route is still accessible via external tools such as postman

4. Error messaging on the front-end instead of console logging :)

5. Sort transactions based on completeness
